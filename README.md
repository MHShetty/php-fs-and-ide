# php-fs-and-ide

A server-side file system and web based IDE written in PHP (specially designed to edit PHP files) to make the entire development process a lot more easier and faster. It has a lot of additional features such as hot-reload which allows the developer to immediately see the output, right beside the editor window on the same page as soon as the file is saved and it also has support for custom error reporting with the help of a unique mechanism that is exclusively available via this IDE (at least as of writing this description).
